# urban_dictionary

In this project I've practiced my knowledge in Flutter and Dart. It consumes the Urban Dictionary API, and you can search for a word or expression, as well as see details on the search results. I took the care to comment it, drawing parallels between Flutter concepts and Swift concepts; the latter is my main programming language.

## Getting Started
